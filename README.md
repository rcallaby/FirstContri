# FirstContri
This is a website where one can find Good First Issue of a particular git-hub repository. It has features like filtering out Documention, Good First Issues and many more. Will add a few features in the future.

# Getting started
Firstly to start contributing for any project or opensource program you need to Fork the repository first.
After forking clone the repo on your local machine. This will help you to make changes and review it personally.

To clone :
```
git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/{repository}
```
Here in this case the repository will be FirstContrib

After Cloning you can contribute via Issues or make PRs


# Using Docker 
You can also run this app / read the code / contribute it / upgrade it by using the Docker image of this project

To pull the docker image :
```
docker pull hanshal101/firstcontri:v1.0
```
Here, v1.0 indicates the version of the image. Since we have just started its on the initial stages. We will add new features and upgrade the versions simultaneously.

After pulling the Image Run this command :
```
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d hanshal101/firstcontri:v1.0
```

This command will expose the port-5000 of your machine to the image which will help it to host the application.

*Note - Docker Login is required to download the docker image*
